•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This application was designed to help users to keep track of events that may come up in their lives. The goal was to have an app that would allow the user to input events into a calendar that will remind them later on via SMS Text. The user would put the name of the event and the time when the event would take place on a certain date. The user is required to create a username and password for login purposes. This allows the events to be saved to a particular user. The user will also have to option to opt in to allowing the app to access the user’s SMS texts. Once the user has created a new event, they would be allowed to edit or delete the event. This application helps the user to remember all the events that arise within their daily lives. It is mostly intended for users who have a hectic schedule such as a busy parent trying to keep up with all their kids school events and such. 

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Keeping the screens to a minimum was a goal of mine. Too many things for the user to do within the app makes it feel cumbersome. This could lead the user to not want to user this app. The opening screen is the sign in or sign-up page. Once signed in the user is brought to the monthly calendar view to see the whole month of events. Pressing the weekly calendar button at the top allows the user to jump to a weekly view. On the left and right side of both the monthly and weekly views allow the user to jump to the next/previous month or next/previous week. On the weekly view users are allowed to select a date and add a new event. By selecting the new event button, the user is brought to the event edit page where they can input the event details. Once this is completed the user will save the event. They are then brought back to the weekly view and the event is now visible under this date. 

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I first wanted to get the look of each page down before I started coding functionality . Once I thought I had a look and feel to the application that was satisfactory I started on the functional code. For this I made sure to test each change early and often. I also tried not to write too much before testing. I also would research how in implement certain things like SQLite into the application. I made sure to take my time with each implementation as I would run into errors often when trying to rush. In the future when coding remaining patient will be key in stressful situations. Additionally, reaching out for help in the more difficult tasks will ensure that I am exhausting every resource I have.  

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I would test my code by running it in the Android Studio emulator. Once the application is running in the emulator, I would try out the functions that I had implemented to ensure that they were working as I intended them to. If something were not working right, I would first check the debugger to make sure that there were no syntax errors. From there if there were not, I would check the logic of the code. This is important because the functionality of the application is paramount. Additionally, testing with each implementation of new functions ensures that everything else within the code is working properly. This will help to eliminate items from a checklist in the future should an error occur. 

•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When selecting a time for each event became an issue, I tried to find a solution that would be better than just a text input. I referred to our ZYBooks work and remembered that there was a way to implement a clock selection. I did this but needed this time to be reflected in the event description. Once I found a way to display this time as text, I was able to show the event name and time while making the time selection for user much easier. 

•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I thought my ability to use buttons and have those buttons transition to other area of the application to be very well done. Making new pages with new content was an area that I had some reservations about at first but once getting into the actual coding for the application, found to be very enjoyable. Each button serves a purpose, and they fulfill their purpose exactly the way I wanted them to.
